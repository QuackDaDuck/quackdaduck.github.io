Website Development Log – HTML Executor
Developer: QuackDaDuck
Current Version: v1.3.2
Project Type: Static HTML site

v1.0.0 – First Build (Prototype via data: URI)
- Built and shared as a data:text/html link.
- Console and upload logic were messy but barely functional.
- No real structure, no automatic behavior, and no hosting.
- Used as proof of concept only.
- Known issues: inconsistent behavior, no feedback, and no anti-close protection.

v1.2.0 – Full Working Patch
- Same delivery method (data: link), but cleaned up the core logic.
- File upload and HTML execution worked end-to-end.
- Added script injection via TempFunction() or similar logic.
- Included beforeunload anti-close handler for safety.
- Console printed code or logs cleanly.
- First version that felt usable.

v1.3.0 – Public Hosting and Real Launch
- Moved to a real URL (hosted website).
- No longer required data: tricks.
- Cleaner startup behavior added.
- File input could be triggered from button reliably.
- Site was now usable from anywhere, not just locally.

v1.3.2 – Startup Automation and Versioning Patch
- Footer includes visible version number ("v1.3.2").
- Button styling improved with hover states.
- Code injection still includes anti-close script block.
- Final polish patch before future expansion.
